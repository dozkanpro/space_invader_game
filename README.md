# Introduction
  A clone of the classic arcade game where you shoot down alien ships is built using Python Turtle.
  
  Your space ship can move left and right and it can hit some alien ships.
  
  Every second the aliens will move closer to your ship.
  
  When bullet hit the aliens, score is increased by 1.
  
  Once the aliens touch your ship then it's game over.
